# Colorful Pandas

[Handbook](https://handbook.colorful-pandas.com)

This repository is a work in progress right now.  
Expect large changes and lack of documentation. The handbook isn't always updated at the same time as changes are made
since I am committing to it irregularly.  

You should search for all documentation in the handbook. If it's not there, it doesn't exist. This is my side-project,
and I am making it source-available for other people to learn from. I hope it's a great learning resource for
projects that do not just need the "Click-to-deploy" experience so many platforms offer nowadays, but focus on great
day 2 operations.
